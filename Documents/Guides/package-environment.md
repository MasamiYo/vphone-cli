# Package Environment

The VM has no package manager by default. To install one:

1. In the menu bar, choose **Apps > Install Bootstrap…** and select the **roothide** layout (**rootless** is deprecated). This installs Irisin in the VM.
2. In Irisin, open the **OwnGoal Packages** repository, find **OwnGoal Bootstrap for vphone** (`owngoal-bootstrap-vphone`), and install it with **Bootstrap Install**.

   This one package brings in everything a VM needs in a single pass: `apt` and `dpkg`, `bash`, `zsh` and `dash`, `sudo`, the core command-line tools, `openssh-server`, `curl`, `wget`, `vim`, `git`, `uikittools`, `launchctl`, and the OwnGoal apps. Do not install these packages one by one: several depend on one another, and `openssh-server` declares some dependencies circularly, so separate installs can fail partway.
3. After the first installation, install further packages normally.

If the first installation fails, do not repair it in place. Choose **Apps > Uninstall Bootstrap…**, then start again from step 1.

## Remove the Environment

Choose **Apps > Uninstall Bootstrap…**. The VM restarts after removal.

Hold Option while opening the **Apps** menu to see two more options:

- **Install Bootstrap from File…:** Installs from a local Irisin `.deb`.
- **Uninstall Bootstrap Without Restarting…:** Removes the environment without restarting the VM.
