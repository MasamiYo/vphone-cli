// MARK: - APFS Snapshots

/// `apfs.snapshots` lists a volume's snapshots; `apfs.snapshot.delete`
/// removes the `orig-fs.disabled.rn-*` snapshot CFW install leaves on the
/// system volume, and nothing else (`GuestSnapshotPolicy`). Until it is gone,
/// files trimmed from the system volume free no space: the snapshot still
/// references their blocks. The guest TRIMs the freed blocks within seconds,
/// so the host's disk image shrinks without a reboot. The host cannot do this
/// itself: its SIP refuses to delete snapshots of a System-role volume.
/// `Research/Guest/template_snapshot_deletion.md` has the measurements.
