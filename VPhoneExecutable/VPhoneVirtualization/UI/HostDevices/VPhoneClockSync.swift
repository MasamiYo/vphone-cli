/// Call `start()` when the guest reports the "clock" capability, on every
/// connect: it sends the Mac's time, then again every minute, when the Mac
/// wakes and when the Mac's own clock is set. vphoned leaves a clock within a
/// second of the Mac's alone, and one set by hand in the guest's Settings.
