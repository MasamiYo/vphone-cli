// FirmwareGuestPatchResolutionTests.swift — The guest-half selection resolver.
//
// `FirmwareGuestPatchResolution` decides which patches the guest half of an
// install applies now: the boot chain as the plan recorded it, the guest half
// as the current selection resolves it. These tests pin that split and the
// membership of the guest-target set against the real bundled catalogue.
