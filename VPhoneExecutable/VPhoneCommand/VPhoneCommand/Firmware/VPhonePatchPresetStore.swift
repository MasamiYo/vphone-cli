// VPhonePatchPresetStore.swift — Finding presets, and remembering a VM's choice.
//
// Three files matter here.
//
// `VPhone.bundle/Contents/Resources/patches_presets/*.plist` are the presets the
// bundle ships. They are prewritten and reviewed; nothing in the tool writes one.
//
// `<vm>/PatchSelection.plist` is the VM's choice: which preset, and which patches
// the user unchecked. It is written when the VM is created or edited, and read by
// `fw patch`.
//
// `<vm>/PatchPlan.plist` is what `fw patch` actually resolved, written after the
// boot chain is patched. `cfw install` reads it so the guest half of the install
// applies the same selection the boot chain was built with, without resolving the
// preset a second time against versions that may since have changed.
