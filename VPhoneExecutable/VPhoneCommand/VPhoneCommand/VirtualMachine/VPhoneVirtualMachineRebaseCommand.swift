        commandName: "rebase",
        abstract: "Share a stopped VM's identical disk blocks with another VM or a template",
        discussion: """
        Compares the disk images of a stopped VM and a base and rebuilds the VM's from an \
        APFS clone of the base's, writing only the blocks that differ. Wherever both images \
        hold the same bytes at the same offset (for VMs restored from the same IPSW, most of \
        the system volume), the blocks are then stored once for both. Every byte is checked \
        against the original before it is replaced, so the guest sees exactly the same disk; \
        SEPStorage, nvram.bin, config.plist and the device identity are not touched.

        The base is another stopped VM or a template from `vm template list`, by identifier \
        or unique prefix; a VM wins when a name matches both. A template is never booted, so \
        it makes the best base: its image does not drift. The rebase only reads it, and the \
        rebased VM does not become one of its clones (it keeps its own SEP storage and \
        identity, and `vm template show` does not list it).

        Identical bytes that are already the same blocks on disk, as in two VMs cloned from \
        one template, are reported as already shared: rebasing them frees nothing. The \
        saving is the newly shared bytes.

        Both must be on one APFS volume. The rebase needs free space for the blocks it \
        writes until the old image is released. The space comes back only if nothing else \
        holds the old image's blocks: snapshots of the VM, and clones made from it, keep \
        them. du and Finder still report the full size of each image; free space on the \
        volume is the honest measure. The two images drift apart again as either side writes.

        --dry-run only compares the images and reports what a rebase would share and write.
