// FirmwarePatchDrift.swift — Where a VM's patches stand, and what a change still needs.
//
// A VM carries three patch records: the selection (what the owner wants), the
// plan (what the last `fw patch` built) and the receipt (what is live in the
// guest, part by part). This file compares them. It reads no file and writes
// none: `fw patches`, `fw set-patches` and `restore` hand it the records they
// already loaded, so the comparison is one pure rule the tests can pin.
//
// Parts are named by the caller's rule (`VPhoneVirtualMachinePatchReceipt.part(for:)`
// in `vphone-cli`), passed in as a closure so the receipt stays the one place
// that spells a part key.
