// DyldSharedCacheIOMFBForceKernPatcher.swift — Route IOMobileFramebuffer presents
// to the kernel only for connections that actually have a kernel userclient.
//
// Why
// ---
// On vphone600 26.x the host `VZVirtualMachineView` is fed by the guest
// `AppleParavirtGPU` scanout, and the 26.4 kernel drives that scanout ONLY from
// the IOMFB userclient swap methods — the `_kern_Swap*` family, of which
// `_kern_SwapEnd` is external method 5. A 26.x userland presents through
// `_kern_*`, which is why the SwapEnd size patch fixed the VZ view on 26.0/18.x.
//
// iOS 27 routes the paravirt display's present through the PARALLEL `_virt_Swap*`
// family instead. `_virt_SwapEnd` performs no userclient call: it invokes an
// in-process callback and hands the composited IOSurface to a virtual-display
// consumer. Those frames never enter the kernel userclient, so the paravirt GPU
// never scans out and the host VZ window stays black — the guest still
// composites (the GUI is visible over the in-guest TrollVNC capturer) and
// AppleParavirtGPU's scheduler sits idle.
//
// What is rewritten
// -----------------
// The public `_IOMobileFramebufferSwap*` entry points are thin dispatch
// trampolines that tail-call a per-connection function pointer. On iOS 27 the
// capture display has no kernel userclient port, while the paravirtual primary
// display does. The patch therefore replaces each trampoline with:
//
//     cbz   x0, <fail>
//     ldr   w16, [x0, #0x14]       ; IOConnect port (zero for display 2)
//     cbnz  w16, _kern_Swap<Name>
//     b     _virt_Swap<Name>
//
// x16 is an intra-procedure-call scratch register, so the public ABI arguments
// remain untouched on either direct branch. The port offset is anchored by the
// `_kern_Swap*` implementations, which all pass `[x0,#0x14]` to the external
// method call.
//
// Companion kernel patch: `KernelCustomFirmwarePatcher.patchIomfbSwapEndVariableSize` /
// `…HandlerSize`, which make the 26.4 userclient accept iOS 27's native 0x6e0
// SwapEnd struct (26.x sent 0x588). Both halves are required together — forcing
// kern without the kernel size-accept makes method 5 return
// `kIOReturnBadArgument`.
//
// Entry-point addresses and both siblings are resolved by name through
// `DyldSharedCacheSymbolResolver` (export trie and cache symbols). Capstone
// verifies the trampoline's typed operands; ARM64Encoder produces the four
// replacement instructions. The connection layout's port offset is 0x14 on
// the verified cache. Modified pages are re-attested through the chunk span log.
//
// Classify the complete candidate set before writing, and require Begin, End,
// and SetLayer coverage. Unlike the historical unconditional patch, only
// operations with both kern and virt siblings participate. Real-cache tests
// verify conditional routing, preserved null handling, dry-run and idempotence.
