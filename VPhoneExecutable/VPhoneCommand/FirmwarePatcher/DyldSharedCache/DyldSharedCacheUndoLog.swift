// DyldSharedCacheUndoLog.swift — The original bytes behind every dyld-shared-cache edit.
//
// The shared cache is several gigabytes, so turning a cache patch back off
// cannot mean keeping a pristine copy. It means knowing, byte for byte, what
// each patch overwrote. Before a `DyldSharedCacheChunkSet` writes, it reads the
// bytes it is about to replace and appends them here, tagged with the chunk
// file and the file offset they came from. A later run that finds a patch now
// deselected writes those bytes back where they were and re-attests the pages
// they land in, which is byte-for-byte the pristine cache for that patch.
//
// What this does NOT store is the re-attestation writes themselves — the slot
// hashes `DyldSharedCacheCodeSignature` rewrites after a content edit. Those are
// derived, not chosen: the slot hash of a 16 KiB page is the SHA-256 of the
// page. Two patches can land in one page, so restoring one patch's slot bytes
// to "pristine" while the other patch stays would write the wrong hash for a
// page that is not pristine. The correct inverse is therefore: put the content
// bytes back, then re-hash whatever the page now holds. Re-attesting the
// restored page reproduces the pristine slot hash exactly when (and only when)
// the page is now pristine, and the right non-pristine hash otherwise. So the
// undo log records content writes and leaves the slot hashes to be recomputed.
//
// A record is keyed by the patch identifier that wrote it, so a revert can act
// on one patch without disturbing another's bytes. An identifier with no
// records is a patch that wrote nothing — an idempotent no-op on an
// already-patched or self-gated cache — and reverting it is likewise nothing.
