# tvOS support

Validated on 2026-10-15: AppleTV5,3 tvOS 26.4 beta 1 (23L5208m) on the
cloudOS 26.4 beta (23E5207q) vphone600ap platform boots to TVSetup and Settings.
The same VM booted normally with four CPUs after installing the persistent
kernel fix, without a debugger. Arrow keys, Return and Escape navigation were
confirmed by the user. Device > Back sends the same native Escape key pair;
that menu action has not been separately confirmed.

Validation covers the specific donor/kernel pairing listed below. Settings >
About reports tvOS 26.4 (23L5208m), an IPv4 address, and 1080p HD / 120 Hz.
The display mode is reported metadata, not measured rendering performance.
Activation reports Failed and the model is Not Applicable. Apple services,
audio, video playback, third-party apps and long-term stability remain untested.

Later the same day: tvOS 26.6 (23L773), the last release for the Apple TV HD,
restored on the same cloudOS and booted to TVSetup with vphoned running. The
guests now run vphoned (see [vphoned on tvOS](#vphoned-on-tvos)), which gives
the TV button: Home on a press, Control Center when held. The firmware catalog
lists tvOS 26.6 for the Apple TV HD, and New Machine and `vm create --device
AppleTV5,3` build it with the `tvos` preset.

tvOS 27 dropped the Apple TV HD, and Apple publishes no IPSW for any Apple TV
4K: AppleDB lists only OTA packages for AppleTV11,1 and AppleTV14,1, and
AppleTV18,1 is not released. An Apple TV 4K (AppleTV14,1) guest is the HD's
26.6 restore with the 4K's identity and arm64e userland taken from its OTA;
`fw prepare` reads the OTA itself. See
[Apple TV 4K from its OTA](#apple-tv-4k-from-its-ota).

## Firmware and storage

- Donor: Apple TV HD, `AppleTV5,3`, board `j42dap`, plain arm64 / TVOS.
- Kernel, boot chain and SEP: cloudOS 26.4 beta, `vphone600ap`.
- [Apple-hosted donor IPSW](https://updates.cdn-apple.com/2026WinterSeed/fullrestores/089-95491/1679DEB6-820D-40A8-9F28-1735EFDFB01D/AppleTV5,3_26.4_23L5208m_Restore.ipsw).
- Verified SHA-256: `2128c348ffbb0f65096ac3e7be22e901e09773e02c17edbce4c0647769c24ae8`;
  length 5,269,316,627 bytes.
- [tvOS 26.6 IPSW](https://updates.cdn-apple.com/2026SummerFCS/fullrestores/140-67287/F525C1FF-B49B-40AB-A5F4-A6F4A4847407/AppleTV5,3_26.6_23L773_Restore.ipsw),
  the catalog's pairing. SHA-256
  `a5f3e397ba4d8cd03c6c46709b3d8f9811af58a5a2e758e2334317fbc68db292`, as AppleDB
  records it; length 5,269,471,026 bytes.
- The lab reuses one logical 32 GB disk, about 11 GiB allocated. No second
  VM, template, or automatic PCC GPU recovery disk was created.

The matching release numbers motivated the pairing investigation; they do not establish
compatibility with other builds. Every TV pairing uses cloudOS 26.4: the kernel
fix below exists only for its kernel. The beta archive, FirmwareOriginals and
restore tree are retained locally for reproducibility and rollback.

## Creating an Apple TV machine

In Launchpad, New Machine > Device > Apple TV HD. The sheet picks tvOS 26.6
and the `tvos` preset, and turns Use Template and Slim System off: both drive
iOS Setup Assistant and its apps. From the command line:

```zsh
vphone-launchpad-cli vm create tv --device AppleTV5,3 --cpu 4 --memory 4096 --disk-size 32
```

The machine is restored on its own and starts at TVSetup. Navigate with the
arrow keys and Return; Escape goes back, holding it returns to the Home
screen. The titlebar Home button and the Mac's Home key (fn-←) are the TV
button: a click or press goes Home, holding either opens Control Center.
Device > Home Screen (⌘⇧H) and Device > Control Center (⌘⇧T) do the same
through vphoned.

## Reproducing the validated configuration

Use the built bundle's `vphone-cli` on a host configured according to
[host setup](../../Documents/Guides/host-setup.md). Both IPSWs must be supplied
locally: a donor above and cloudOS 23E5207q. Other pairings are unvalidated.
The VM and the installer's temporary directory must share an APFS volume;
TV guest updates refuse an in-place fallback when cloning is unavailable.
Copy-on-write updates share unchanged blocks, but require space for changed data.

For a **new** VM only, run these commands in zsh, replacing the three paths.
Do not run `vm new` or restore against an existing VM you want to preserve.
This manual pipeline creates one 32 GB disk and no template, as `vm create
--device AppleTV5,3` does. The historical `--iphone-source` option accepts the
TV donor.

```zsh
cli='/absolute/path/to/VPhone.bundle/Contents/MacOS/vphone-cli'
tv_ipsw='/absolute/path/to/AppleTV5,3_26.4_23L5208m_Restore.ipsw'
cloud_ipsw='/absolute/path/to/cloudOS_23E5207q_Restore.ipsw'
export VPHONE_LIBRARY_ROOT="$HOME/vphone-tvos"
vm='tvos-26_4-beta'
"$cli" vm new "$vm" --cpu 4 --memory 4096 --disk-size 32
"$cli" fw set-patches "$vm" --preset tvos
"$cli" fw prepare "$vm" --device AppleTV5,3 \
  --iphone-source "$tv_ipsw" --cloudos-source "$cloud_ipsw"
"$cli" fw patch "$vm"
"$cli" vm launch "$vm" --dfu
```

Leave DFU running. In a second terminal, set the same `cli`, `vm` and
`VPHONE_LIBRARY_ROOT` variables, then run:

```zsh
"$cli" restore "$vm"
"$cli" vm stop "$vm"
sudo "$cli" cfw install --library-root "$VPHONE_LIBRARY_ROOT" "$vm" --keep-artifacts
"$cli" vm launch "$vm"
```

If host preflight refuses the VM binary, run its printed allowlist command and
retry the launch. Navigate setup with arrows and Return; Escape goes back.
`vphone-cli vm wait`, or `vphone-launchpad-cli vm wait`, reports when vphoned
answers.

`fw set-patches` replaces all overrides; the `tvos` preset holds the whole
Apple TV selection. On an installed, stopped VM, guest-side changes use `sudo "$cli" cfw
update-environment --library-root "$VPHONE_LIBRARY_ROOT" "$vm"`; kernel changes
use `sudo "$cli" cfw update-kernel --library-root "$VPHONE_LIBRARY_ROOT" "$vm"`.
Neither requires another restore. A prior research installation must first
remove its diagnostic jobs with the preserved research bundle; the PR bundle
does not contain those removed patch implementations.

## Required implementation

1. Admit AppleTV5,3 explicitly. Copy its TV idiom, identity, 1x artwork and
   `app-macho-architecture=arm64` from the donor device tree. The virtual display
   uses 1920x1080; 72 ppi is a provisional VM value, not television metadata.
   Preserve the virtual identity in the restore tree. Non-iPhone restore-tree
   names retain the existing `iPhoneOS_…_Restore` compatibility prefix.
2. Admit the monolithic TV filesystem only after validating its erase identity,
   TVOS platform and required component paths. It contains neither OS nor App
   cryptex; its cache remains at `System/Library/Caches/com.apple.dyld` and uses
   architecture `arm64`. Other guest families keep their cryptex layout.
3. Rehash the unchanged TV `OS`, `SystemVolume`, `StaticTrustCache` and
   `Ap,SystemVolumeCanonicalMetadata` with SHA-384 in the hybrid manifest.
   J42d's SHA-1 donor digests failed PCC metadata authentication and sealing;
   the corrected hybrid restore completed.
4. Apply the existing seputil/gigalocker repair, vphoned and the launchd
   cache gate its job needs. Block unvalidated iOS guest payloads,
   graphics/audio hooks and shared-cache patches; the `tvos` preset does both.
   Preparation skips the GPU driver for an Apple TV, avoiding an unnecessary
   recovery VM whatever order the selection is recorded in.
5. Enable `system-dyld-exp-tv_tpro` and `kernel-exp-tv_tpro_pagers`. Both
   are off in Standard and on in `tvos`, and apply to every tvOS 26 userland
   on cloudOS 26.4. Keep the donor's
   native shared cache and page-in linking intact.
6. Forward Escape to the TV's native virtual keyboard instead of consuming
   it as an iPhone edge swipe. Device > Back uses the same keyboard path,
   without vphoned. Backspace remains available for editing text. Home and
   Control Center go through vphoned (below).

The dyld operation rewrites only the exact `dyld_hw_tpro` and
`dyld_hw_tpro_pagers` parameter-name prefixes to `vphn`, in both standalone
and cached dyld. It validates TVOS/arm64, symbol bounds, getenv references and
presence checks, then re-attests the modified code-signature slots. A backup
and shared-cache undo record support paired rollback. An existing patch must
have both records before another write. Paired failures abort the install and
discard its private disk clone; rollback retires undo only after both images
are restored.

## Kernel cause and persistent fix

The embedded research kernel UUID was
`784F88D3-2AF5-3D4A-AB00-365607646E44`. Native runtime tracing caught
MobileGestaltHelper, UUID `7CF0ED37-E30C-38AA-AE6C-F10A7CA15BC8`, at a libobjc
store with ESR `0x9200004f` and unslid FAR `0x1ea57c808`. Its DATA_CONST
RW|COPY request (`0x13`, size `0xa23c000`) returned KERN_PROTECTION_FAILURE.
Following the remap/extract calls showed a TPRO-tagged map entry while dyld
used an ordinary writable request. The source entry allowed maximum RW.
The local symbol dataset was unavailable; function descriptions were derived
from native control flow and correlated with XNU, not claimed symbol lookups.

The native `sprr_tpro_pagers` tunable controls tagging these ranges. Setting
its live value from 1 to 0 made subsequent COPY requests succeed and allowed
TVSetup to appear. No other functional debugger write was made.

The persistent patch changes only the integer tunable's initial four bytes.
It locates the unique NUL-terminated name, validates the four-byte integer
startup descriptor and its data pointer, and requires one TUNABLES registration
with an executable initializer. It accepts only defaults 0 or 1. Both segment
bounds and actual file bounds are checked. The fileset's outer `__DATA` contains
the embedded `__KLDDATA`. No observed offsets or instruction words are baked
into the patch; unsupported or ambiguous layouts fail the selected operation.
The tunable lives in the cloudOS 26.4 kernel, whatever tvOS userland it runs,
so the patch applies to every tvOS 26 donor on that kernel. tvOS 26.6 (23L773)
needed the same fix and booted with it.

`cfw update-kernel` rebuilt from FirmwareOriginals and replaced only the
installed Preboot kernel payload, retaining the manifest and volumes. A normal
four-CPU boot subsequently reached the Language screen, and the user navigated
to Settings > About. Disabling the kernel patch and running the same command
rebuilds from pristine bytes; the dyld operation is separately reversible.

## Validation and PR scope

The trimmed PR passed:

- 89 tests in seven firmware suites, including the real research kernel's
  exact four-byte change, blocked-gate byte identity and malformed/truncated
  tunable descriptor rejection.
- 36 final follow-up tests in four suites covering TV guest patch admission,
  TV dyld, patch declarations,
  missing-backup rejection and injected rollback failures. These overlap
  the preceding firmware suites and are not an additional unique-test count.
- 17 core identity/catalog tests, 15 archive admission tests, and the
  Launchpad IPSW classification tests.
- The final complete VPhone bundle build and bundle admission checks.
- A normal four-CPU, 4 GiB boot after removing the diagnostic patches. The
  user confirmed the UI works and Escape goes back. Device > Back uses the
  same key path but has not been separately confirmed.

The PR excludes diagnostic executables, launchd logging/cache modifications,
the abandoned page-in-linking fallback and the unused conclave change.
The lab's guest receipt after cleanup contains only TV dyld TPRO and the two
seputil/gigalocker repairs. TV environment updates recognize the guest receipt
when vphoned is omitted. Unreadable cache undo logs abort instead of being
silently replaced.

Native arrow, Return and Escape input does not require vphoned; the titlebar
Home button and Control Center do, and work now that the guest runs it.
Activation, model metadata, audio and Apple services retain the limitations
listed above; this validation does not establish full Apple TV compatibility.

Research helpers and the prior bundle are retained locally under
`.build/tvos-research/pr-backup`, outside the PR. Boot evidence is in
`.build/tvos-research/pr-clean-boot.log`; the Settings screenshot and earlier
native runtime transcripts remain beside it. No second VM disk was created.

## vphoned on tvOS

vphoned is an arm64 Mach-O, so the plain-arm64 TV userland can run it, and
every symbol it imports resolves in the tvOS 26.4 shared cache, UIPasteboard
and UIScreen included. Installed unchanged, it never started: each launch
left a crash report, `Library not loaded: …/Foundation.framework/Foundation …
(wrong platform to load into process)`. dyld takes the process platform from
the main executable, and vphoned's `LC_BUILD_VERSION` says iOS (2) while every
library in the cache says tvOS (3).

The bundle build now ships `guest-resources/vphoned-tvos`: the same binary
with `vtool -set-build-version tvos 15.0 <sdk> -replace`, signed with
vphoned's entitlements. `ValidateBundle.sh` requires it to be TVOS and every
other guest binary to be IOS. `cfw install` installs it for an Apple TV guest,
and launch stages it as `.vphoned.signed`, so the host's hash check keeps the
TV copy current instead of replacing it with the iOS one.

Its launchd job goes into `/System/Library/xpc/launchd.plist` as on iOS. The
`launchd_cache_loader` gate patch found and NOPed the same branch in the
plain-arm64 loader (`0xB00` in 23L5208m), and the console then shows `Using
unsecure cache: /System/Library/xpc/launchd.plist`. Both are now admitted for
TV (`FirmwareGuestPatchResolution.tvSupportedGuestPatches`). The environment
hooks (`system-launchdaemons-boot-environment`) stay blocked; they have no TV
port.

Verified on 23L5208m and 23L773: `vm wait` returns, `device.info` reports
`own_name` "Apple TV", screenshots and `apps.launch` work, and consumer-page
HID input moves the TVSetup focus.

## TV button, Home and Control Center

A USB keyboard cannot press the TV button: no keyboard-page key maps to it.
UIKit's `_UIEventHIDPressTypeForKeyboardHIDEvent` (UIKitCore, 23L5208m) maps
consumer page `0x0C`:

| Usage | Press type | Button |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0x40` Menu | 17 | TV / Home |
| `0x1C0` | 500 | TV / Home (second type) |
| `0x223` AC Home | 101 | game controller Home |
| `0x30` Power | 104 | Power |
| `0x41`–`0x46` | 4, 0–3, 5 | Select, arrows, Menu |
| `0xE9` / `0xEA` | 102 / 103 | Volume |

PineBoard's `+[PBSystemGestureRecipe recipeForType:]` presents Control Center
(system gesture `0x1d`) on a long press of press types 17 or 500, on a press of
104 when the `allowPowerButtonToOpenControlCenter` default is set, or on the
game controller's Home. A long press of Menu (5) runs
`_cleanUpUIStackAndLaunchKioskAppWithReason:@"Long MENU press"`, so holding
Escape also returns to the Home screen.

vphoned's `input.hid` injects consumer events inside the guest. The existing
Home Screen action already sends `0x0C/0x40`. For an Apple TV guest the titlebar
Home button sends the press when the mouse goes down and the release when it
comes up, and the Mac's Home key (fn-← on a laptop) does the same with its
key down and up, so either one held opens Control Center. Device > Control Center, shown
only for an Apple TV guest, holds the same usage for 1.2 s. On 23L5208m a
`0x0C/0x40` press over `input.hid` returned from Settings to the Home screen,
and a 1.5 s hold opened Control Center.

## Apple TV 4K from its OTA

Apple publishes no IPSW for any Apple TV 4K. The full tvOS 26.6 (23L773) OTA
for AppleTV14,1 (J255, A15) is a 4.76 GB AEA archive whose key AppleDB records.
Its userland is arm64e and, like the HD's, monolithic: no cryptexes. It ships
the IOGPU Metal stack, and every import of the paravirtual GPU driver resolves
in its shared cache. The OTA has no root filesystem image, only 37
`payloadv2/payload.NNN` chunks, each a `pbzx`-compressed Apple Archive with
owners, modes, BSD flags and APFS compression per entry, plus the root
filesystem's `.mtree` (an IM4P `msys` around a `pbze`/LZFSE Apple Archive
manifest), `.root_hash` and `.trustcache`, and the J255 device tree.

An Apple TV 4K guest is the Apple TV HD's 26.6 IPSW (same build) restored with
the J255 identity, its userland swapped for the OTA's in `cfw install`.

### Creating one

```zsh
vphone-launchpad-cli vm create tv4k --device AppleTV14,1 --cpu 4 --memory 4096 --disk-size 48
```

or `vphone-cli vm create tv4k --device AppleTV14,1`, or in Launchpad New
Machine > Device > Apple TV 4K (3rd generation). The firmware catalog pairs the
4K with the HD's 26.6 IPSW and cloudOS 26.4, and lists the OTA's URL, length
and key; `fw prepare` downloads the OTA into `<ipsw cache>/ota/` under
`AppleTV14,1_26.6_23L773_OTA.aea`, or uses the copy already there. The machine
gets the `tvos-4k` preset. Step by step, with local files:

```zsh
"$cli" vm new tv4k --cpu 4 --memory 4096 --disk-size 48
"$cli" fw set-patches tv4k --preset tvos-4k
"$cli" fw prepare tv4k --device AppleTV14,1 \
  --iphone-source "$hd_266_ipsw" --cloudos-source "$cloud_ipsw" \
  --ota-source ~/.vphone/ipsws/ota/AppleTV14,1_26.6_23L773_OTA.aea
"$cli" fw patch tv4k
```

then DFU, `restore`, `cfw install` and launch as for the HD. `--ota-key
<base64>` gives the key for an OTA the catalog does not list; a local OTA of a
listed build takes the catalog's key.

### What `fw prepare` does

`fw prepare --device AppleTV14,1` resolves the IPSW as the HD's
(`VPhoneGuestDevice.restoreBase`), so the restore tree is
`iPhoneOS_AppleTV5,3_26.6_23L773_Restore` and the hybrid manifest is built
from the HD's identity, as for an HD guest. Then, with
`VPhoneOTAArchive` (`VPhoneKit/VPhoneArchiveKit/Transfer`):

1. Before any IPSW is unpacked, the OTA is decrypted far enough to read
   `AssetData/boot/BuildManifest.plist`: it must list AppleTV14,1 and be the
   IPSW's build. A wrong key fails here too.
2. After the restore tree is built, one pass over the OTA writes
   `AssetData/boot/Firmware/all_flash/DeviceTree.j255ap.im4p` into the
   tree's `Firmware/all_flash`, beside J42d's, and every
   `AssetData/payloadv2/payload.NNN` plus `payload_chunks.txt` into
   `<vm>/OTAUserland`. The `.ecc` files, firmware, kernel and BOMs are skipped.
   The chunks must be numbered from 0 and match the list one for one. The
   folder is assembled under a temporary name and renamed into place; a
   prepare for any other firmware removes a stale one.
3. `config.plist` records AppleTV14,1 and its 3840x2160 @2x screen. The
   paravirtual GPU driver and compiler plugin are staged into `.pcc-gpu` as for
   an iPhone: only a plain-arm64 guest skips them.

The reader uses the system AppleArchive framework (`libAppleArchive`), no
`ipsw`, `aea` or `aa` process. `ArchiveEncryptionContext` reads the AEA
header and takes the symmetric key; `ArchiveByteStream.decryptionStream`
returns nil for a wrong key. The decrypted archive is segmented: its top-level
entries are metadata (`TYP=M`), and each `YOP=E` (extract) entry's `DAT` blob
is another, uncompressed Apple Archive with the next run of files; `YOP=M` is
the segment manifest and `YOP=O` the owner and mode fix-ups. Each segment is
decoded from its parent's blob through a custom byte stream, and members stream
to disk in 8 MiB blocks, so the 4.76 GB OTA is read once and never held in
memory: the pass over the real OTA takes about a second. A decrypted archive
(`AA01`, or `pbz*` compressed) reads the same way without a key.
AppleArchive's Swift wrappers close their stream when released and a decoder
does not retain its input, so every layer is kept alive until the read ends;
without that the first header read fails with `ioError`.

`fw patch` keeps the recorded AppleTV14,1 although the HD manifest does not
list it, and `cfw install` takes the guest's own board tree when J42d's is
there too.

### What `cfw install` does

`system-tv-exp-ota_userland` empties the System volume and runs `/usr/bin/aa
extract` for each chunk as root, before every other guest step, then records
the chunk list on the volume so an environment update does not extract it
again. The GPU driver and compiler plugin get `LC_BUILD_VERSION` platform tvOS
(`MachOBuildPlatform`), an Apple ad-hoc re-sign and a resealed bundle; AMFI's
trust-cache check is already patched to accept any cdhash, so the HD's static
trust cache does not matter.

The `tvos-4k` preset is `tvos` with the GPU bundle and
`system-tv-exp-ota_userland` on and both TV TPRO patches off: arm64e dyld
handles hardware TPRO, and those patches are for plain-arm64 dyld only. The
installer admits the GPU bundle and the userland swap only for an arm64e TV
guest (`FirmwareGuestPatchResolution.tvArm64eGuestPatches`).

### Results

Prototype, 2026-10-15 (VM `tvtest-4k`, staged by hand with `ipsw`): the guest
boots to the tvOS home screen. vphoned answers with `model` AppleTV14,1, tvOS
26.6, a 1920x1080-point screen at 2x; screenshots are 3840x2160. Control
Center's platters and the dock shelf render as materials. On the host the VM
has five `ParavirtualizedGraphicsGPUTask` processes (each HD guest has two),
and one had used 4.5 s of GPU time while every HD guest task read 0: the guest
renders through the paravirtual GPU. Settings > About reports tvOS 26.6
(23L773) and 2160p UHD at 120 Hz. Holding the TV button over `input.hid`
opened Control Center with frosted tiles, and the VM's GPU task (attributed to
its launcher by `responsibility_get_pid_responsible_for_pid`) gained GPU time
meanwhile.

Native path, 2026-10-15 (VM `tv4k-native`, `vphone-launchpad-cli vm create
--device AppleTV14,1 --preset tvos-4k --no-template` with the local HD and
cloudOS IPSWs): `fw prepare` found the OTA already in `~/.vphone/ipsws/ota/`
under its catalog name, checked its manifest, and staged J255's tree and the 37
chunks; the staged chunks are byte-identical to `ipsw`'s. Restore and `cfw
install` (93 patches, userland extracted, GPU driver retargeted) completed and
vphoned answered on the first boot. The guest starts at TVSetup's Language
screen at 3840x2160 with the Siri Remote artwork of the 4K, `device.info`
reports tvOS 26.6, and the VM has four `ParavirtualizedGraphicsGPUTask`
processes, one of whose GPU time went from 0.27 s to 0.95 s over twelve focus
moves sent with `input.hid`. The installed Launchpad (2.9.2) predates the
Apple TV support in New Machine and ran the iOS template trim and setup boot
after the install; setup failed at the service profile, which has no TV port.
That does not touch the steps above, and the guest booted normally afterwards.

Open issue, display freeze on the 4K: after some time of use, mostly after the
app switcher, `tvtest-4k` stopped updating its screen. Input still reached
PineBoard, `input.hid` and vphoned kept answering, the GPU task kept gaining
GPU time and the host kept scanning out the last frame. A guest spindump
(`/usr/sbin/spindump -notarget 8 10` started as a launchd job through vphoned's
`services.load`, symbols from `ipsw dyld a2s`) showed
`com.apple.coreanimation.display.primary`
(`CA::WindowServer::IOMFBServer::thread_body`) starved while the rest of
backboardd ran. The HD never froze. A 20-minute soak (launch Settings, move
focus, open the app switcher, then check that holding the TV button changes
the screen) found no freeze at 60 Hz (87 cycles, `kernel-cfw-display_promotion`
blocked) or at 120 Hz (40 cycles), so the refresh rate is not shown to be the
cause and the trigger is still unknown.


Apps, video, long-term stability and Apple services are untested.

## tvOS 27 on the Apple TV 4K

tvOS 27 dropped the Apple TV HD (AppleTV5,3) and the first 4K (AppleTV6,2);
AppleDB lists 27.0 (24J361) and the 27.2 betas for AppleTV11,1 and AppleTV14,1
only, as OTAs and recovery images, with no IPSW for any device. The 27.0 full
OTA for AppleTV14,1 is a 4.83 GB AEA archive whose key AppleDB records. Its
layout is the 26.6 one: monolithic, no cryptex, `payloadv2` chunks, the root
filesystem's `.mtree`, `.root_hash` and `.trustcache`, and the J255 device tree.
(Checked on the AppleTV11,1 27.0 OTA, a plain zip, from its central directory.)

So a 27 guest is the 26.6 one with a later OTA: the HD's last IPSW, 26.6, is
the restore base and only the userland changes. `VPhoneOTARelease.baseVersion`
records the base an OTA goes over. The 4K's tvOS 27.0 pairing names the OTA
itself, and `fw prepare` maps a catalog OTA given as `--iphone-source` to its
base IPSW and stages that OTA:

```zsh
vphone-launchpad-cli vm create tv27 --device AppleTV14,1 --preset tvos-4k --no-template \
  --iphone-source https://updates.cdn-apple.com/2026FallFCS/fbf3c544-b770-4756-9cca-abfb2d3cb65e/com_apple_MobileAsset_SoftwareUpdate/9bf3ad6ac49c25016599bbb77d8ea1c612cb745eb7ee9e502af1926c860b7e18.aea \
  --cloudos-source https://updates.cdn-apple.com/private-cloud-compute/c0ecdb4b310cf5239ab2b248dd3098eec297dc5aa3bbe6ada27273262b0b8b64
```

`fw prepare` also writes `OTA-SystemVersion.plist` (the OTA's version and
build) into the restore tree, and the pipeline takes the base version from it
before `iPhone-BuildManifest.plist`: the guest patches meet the 27 userland, not
the 26.6 one, so the plan has to resolve for 27. The `tvos-4k` preset turns on
the iOS 27 shared-cache patches (`FirmwarePatchSetCatalog.tvOS27UserlandPatches`:
`dyld-boot-iomfb_force_kern`, `dyld-boot-lockdown_mode`,
`dyld-boot-lsd_embedded_reg`, `dyld-boot-maxslide`, `dyld-boot-xpc_lwcr`), which
an arm64e TV guest admits; each is gated on 27, so a 26.6 4K never meets them.
The iOS 27 kernel patches (`kernel-boot-iomfb_swapend` and the others gated on
27) come with the plan's version. `system-tv-exp-ota_userland` was gated on 26
and a 27 plan dropped it: the HD's plain-arm64 26.6 userland then booted on the
J255 identity and panicked at first boot. It now applies from 26.0 on, and `cfw
install` refuses a full install of a device without an IPSW whose plan lacks it.

Result, 2026-10-16 (VM `tv27-4k`, cloudOS 26.4, 104 patches): first boot
reached TVSetup's Language screen and vphoned answered. `device.info` reports
AppleTV14,1 at version 27.0.0 with a 1920x1080-point screen at 2x;
screenshots are 3840x2160. The host window shows the guest screen, so tvOS 27,
like iOS 27, presents through `_virt_Swap*` and needs the force-kern patch on
the 26.4 kernel. Six focus moves over `input.hid` moved the selection to
Deutsch (the title became "Sprache"), and the VM's paravirtual GPU task gained
0.31 s of GPU time meanwhile. locationd, backboardd and PineBoard kept their
pids over a minute. The vphoned `services.print` RPC kills vphoned on this
guest every time (launchd restarts it within seconds), as icli's launchd session
lookup does on tvOS; other RPCs work. The locationd startup deadlock iOS 27
userlands hit on the 26.4 kernel (`Research/Guest/locationd_startup_deadlock.md`)
has not been measured over repeated boots here.
