# Device attitude simulation

## Contract and panel

vphoned capability `motion_attitude` exposes `motion.attitude.get`,
`motion.attitude.set {roll,pitch,yaw,enabled?}` and `motion.attitude.clear`.
Set requires finite JSON numbers: roll/yaw in [-180,180] degrees, pitch in
[-90,90]. Booleans, strings, missing/non-finite/out-of-range angles are rejected.
`enabled` must be a Boolean and defaults to true. Clear disables and zeros;
set with enabled=false retains angles.

**Features → Motion Sensors → Device Attitude** (Chinese:
**功能 → 运动传感器 → 设备姿态**) offers immediate edits, a simulation checkbox
and zero reset preserving the checkbox. The gyro panel is in the same submenu.
Both share the serialized/coalesced writer and retry/reconnect model.
UI/RPC use degrees; Core Motion uses radians. Zero is face-up, gravity (0,0,-1)
g. Pitch is about X, roll about Y, yaw about Z: R = Rz(yaw) Rx(pitch) Ry(roll).
Pitch ±90° makes Euler roll/yaw singular; quaternion/matrix remain well-defined.

This is a stationary pose, independent of raw gyro simulation. Device motion
supplies attitude, corresponding gravity, zero rotation rate/user acceleration,
an uncalibrated zero magnetic field and invalid heading (-1). Changing angles
does not synthesize angular velocity or UIKit/display orientation changes.

## Injection and transport

Guest System declares `system-apps-cfw-attitude`, selected by both presets on
iOS 18+. It adds `/usr/lib/libvphoneattitude.dylib`. SystemHook loads it into
apps before the optional tweak loader; no bootstrap or new daemon is required.
Safe-mode/injection-disable flags still apply. No system executable, kernel or
DSC bytes change. This intercepts the app's public Core Motion boundary;
it does not claim that raw gyro HID events are fused attitude samples.

All four CMMotionManager device-motion start methods, stop, interval, polling,
availability, active state and reference-frame getters are covered. Only
XArbitraryZVertical is simulated/advertised. Corrected/magnetic/true-north
requests keep the native path. Enable simulation before launching an app whose
availability check would otherwise prevent subscription.

Per-manager timers honor intervals at 1–200 Hz (unset: 60 Hz). Callbacks run on
the app's NSOperationQueue, outside session locks. At most one simulated
delivery is queued; a suspended queue cannot accumulate samples. Generations
discard deliveries after stop/restart/mode changes. Samples support independent
copies, secure coding and relative quaternion multiplication. Weak timer
captures and cancellation prevent a timer retaining a released manager.
Enabling/disabling an existing subscription switches between simulation and
retained native implementations, including native availability when disabled.

vphoned serializes publication/readback and persists one dictionary,
`VPhoneAttitudeConfiguration`, in mobile's `com.apple.backboardd` preferences.
It packs angles and enabled in one 64-bit Darwin notification state,
`com.vphone.motion.attitude.changed`. Apps read this atomic state without
cross-sandbox preferences/file access. Transport quantizes to 0.001° (maximum
0.0005° error); persisted/RPC values retain input precision. vphoned seeds
notifyd at startup; new app readers immediately read the latest state.

`provider_installed` only reports the dylib's presence. It does not prove a
target app loaded the hook or received samples. Check SystemHook's app-PID
`attitude-hook=... result=loaded` log and the actual Core Motion consumer.

## Selection and verification

cfw install/update-environment follows selection and records the guest receipt.
No-plan legacy VMs do not opt in. Blocking removes the added file; live hash
sync replaces installed selected copies only. Relaunch apps after changing the
library. A changed SystemHook still requires reboot; no UI daemon is restarted
for attitude updates.

Host checks: `make -C VPhoneGuestComponents test-attitude` tests malformed
configuration, packed-state boundaries, quaternion/matrix/gravity, copy,
relative attitude and secure coding. Its real host Core Motion runtime test
covers all start overloads, polling, callback delivery, live toggle, snapshots,
interval setting, bounded backlog and suppression after stop, using a separate
Darwin notification name. The shared editor harness
`zsh VPhoneExecutable/VPhoneVirtualization/Tests/run-gyroscope-tests.sh` covers
sequencing/retry/reconnect and attitude-specific bounds. Catalogue tests cover
version gating, blocking, preset reachability and manifest invariants.

2026-10-08: sample and live hook tests passed, shared editor tests passed,
55 catalogue/model tests in seven suites passed, and the full VPhone Debug
bundle built successfully. Bundle admission and strict deep signature verification
passed; the built zh-Hans strings include 设备姿态 and 俯仰.

Guest acceptance is manual, as requested: update guest, relaunch a consumer,
enable simulation, compare polling/callback Euler radians, quaternion and
gravity at zero and single-axis 90° poses. Check reset/disable while subscribed,
stopped-manager silence, and relaunch after blocking the patch. Host runtime
checks do not establish guest injection/sandbox acceptance or every app's API.
